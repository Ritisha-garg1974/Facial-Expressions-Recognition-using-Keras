# Facial Expressions Recognition usingÂ Keras


The objective of the project:- The aim of this project is to identify people's emotions based on their live video by building and training a system that automatically monitors people's emotions and expressions with more than 24000 facial images, with their associated facial expression labels. The chosen labels were angry, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.


## Steps of the project

Part 1: Importing the libraries and loading the dataset

Part 2: Data augmentation to increase the amount of data artificially by generating new data points from existing data.

Part 3: We will create a sequential deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks to predict the facial expression.

Part 4: Optimising the training using ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, and compiling the model.

Part 5: Test the model
