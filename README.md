# Facial-Expressions-Recognition-using-Keras
The aim of this project is to identify people's emotions based on their live video by building and training a system that automatically monitors people's emotions and expressions with more than 24000 facial images, with their associated facial expression labels. The chosen labels were angry, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
